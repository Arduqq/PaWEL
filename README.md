# PaWEL: Capturing your Heart with Webcams
> This is a public repository of our project on tracking facial data during content consumption. See `/PaWEL` for our heart rate measurement tool.

The objective of this project is to explore the feasibility of utilizing skin color changes as an indicator of states of arousal while individuals engage with potentially controversial social media content. By employing feasible webcam data and conventional image stream processing, we aim to unravel the intricate workings of the Autonomic Nervous System and its relationship with physiological responses.

To accomplish this, we employ video streams as a means to monitor and assess heart rate fluctuations in response to controlled content related to the COVID pandemic. The curated content includes Twitter posts and video data from both public and private personalities, ensuring a diverse range of stimuli for participants to interact with. The central focus of our approach lies in the analysis of skin color changes that occur during the observation of social media content. Through the acquisition of video streams from participants’ webcams and screens, we extract image data for subsequent processing. By employing sophisticated algorithms, we derive photoplethysmogram (PPG) estimates based on temporal variations in skin color. These estimations serve as indicators of fluctuations in heart rate, thereby enabling the identification of heightened physiological arousal.

By aligning the peaks in the photoplethysmogram with the corresponding content segments, we discern the specific elements that elicit pronounced bodily arousal in each participant. Furthermore, this methodology offers the potential to categorize and tag images, videos, and articles as potentially sensitive and provocative based on the observed physiological responses.

During the course of the study, participants engage with sequential content related to the pandemic, while also providing written opinions on their experiences. The comprehensive evaluation of the study incorporates the analysis of heart rate peaks, their correlation with specific content segments, and the participants’ subjective viewpoints regarding pandemic discussions.

Our research endeavors to advance the understanding of human physiological responses to social media content by employing skin color changes as an objective measure of arousal. This investigation, situated within the realm of the Autonomic Nervous System, showcases the potential for more precise and personalized tagging of social media content, particularly within the context of the COVID pandemic. Using accessible technology to help people break out of negative social media habits serves as a first step towards a safer web-browsing experience in commercial, closed-source social media infrastructure.
